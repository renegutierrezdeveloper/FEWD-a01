FEWD assignment 1

## Introduction
I am taking this course because I want to restart my web design/development career as a frontend web developer. I do have some web design/development experience with HTML and CSS, but itâ€™s been some time since I done any web development as a career due to personal circumstances.

I want to learn JavaScript to further my career. JavaScript, I feel, is necessary skillset to have in order to become a good frontend web developer. I hoping to learn a lot in this class.

### My hobbies include:

* Watching sports
* Working out
* Traveling


One of my favorite places to go is Tombstone, Arizona:
